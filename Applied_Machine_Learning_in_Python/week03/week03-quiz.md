### 5.  ###
Using the fitted model `m` create a precision-recall curve to answer the following question:

For the fitted model `m`, approximately what precision can we expect for a recall of 0.8?

(Use y_test and X_test to compute the precision-recall curve. If you wish to view a plot, you can use `plt.show()` )

0.6

y_scores_lr = m.fit(X_train, y_train).decision_function(X_test)

from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve

precision, recall, thresholds = precision_recall_curve(y_test, y_scores_lr)

plt.figure()
plt.xlim([0.0, 1.01])
plt.ylim([0.0, 1.01])
plt.plot(precision, recall, label='Precision-Recall Curve')
plt.xlabel('Precision', fontsize=16)
plt.ylabel('Recall', fontsize=16)
plt.axes().set_aspect('equal')
plt.show()

Using the fitted model `m` what is the micro precision score?

(Use y_test and X_test to compute the precision score.)

0.74

svm_predicted = m.predict(X_test)

print('Micro-averaged precision = {:.3f} (treat instances equally)'
      .format(precision_score(y_test, svm_predicted, average = 'micro')))
	  
### 9. Which of the following is true of the R-Squared metric? (Select all that apply) ###

A model that always predicts the mean of y would get a score of 0.0

**The worst possible score is 0.0**

A model that always predicts the mean of y would get a negative score

### 12. A classifier is trained on an imbalanced multiclass dataset. After looking at the modelâ€™s precision scores, you find that the micro averaging is much smaller than the macro averaging score. Which of the following is most likely happening? ###

The model is probably misclassifying the infrequent labels more than the frequent labels.

**The model is probably misclassifying the frequent labels more than the infrequent labels.**

### 13. Using the already defined RBF SVC model `m`, run a grid search on the parameters C and gamma, for values [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10]. The grid search should find the model that best optimizes for recall. How much better is the recall of this model than the precision? (Compute recall - precision to 3 decimal places) ###
